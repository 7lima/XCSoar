/*
 * From FAI_Tech_Spec_Gnss.pdf 
 * 4.3 F RECORD - SATELLITE CONSTELLATION.
 * This is a mandatory record. However, there is no requirement to update the F-record at intervals of less than 5
 * minutes, so that transient changes of satellites received due to changing angles of bank, flying in valleys, etc do
 * not lead to frequent F-record lines. For the US GPS system, the satellite ID for each satellite is the PRN of the
 * satellite in question, for other satellite systems the ID will be assigned by GFAC as the need arises. Where
 * NMEA data is used within the FR, the ID should be taken from the GSA sentence that lists the IDs of those
 * satellites used in the fixes which are recorded in the B record. The F Record is not recorded continuously but at
 * the start of fixing and then only when a change in satellites used is detected. (AL4)
 */
/* Interpretation:
 * Every logpoint, check if constellation has changed, and set flag if change is detected
 * every 4.5 minutes, if constellation has changed during the period
 * then log the new FRecord
 * Else, don't log it
 * Note: if a NAV Warning exists, we accelerate checking to every 30 seconds for valid constellation.
 * This is not required, but seems advantageous
