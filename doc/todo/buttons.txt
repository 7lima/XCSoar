A quick definition of inputs

* Ignore (asap)

	Just a place holder - do nothing with this one

	DATA: NA

* Hardware Button (asap)

	These are the buttons on the unit itself.

	DATA: "APP1"-"APP6", "UP", "DOWN", "RETURN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"

* Keyboard input (asap)

	If you have a bluetooth device/keyboard you can map letters (eg: "X")
	to a function

	DATA: "A-Z0-9" etc. (note case is ignored!)

* Overlay (future, eg: version 5)

	This is a special type - it is used to create extra buttons on screen
	for those who do not have enough hardware buttons/keyboard etc

	This effectively puts extraâ transparent, navbox type buttons on the
	screen, allowing you to add up to 8 buttons (order added as per 
	order found in the file) extra on the screen. I think the layout of
	said would be the same physical sizeâ lined up with (next to/below) the
	others.

	DATA: Name of button (in other words - anything)

* Gesture (future, eg: version 6)

	In simulator mode we allow drag to give direction and strength. This
	can be useful for wind strength input, or even cursor alternatives
	(eg: zoom in/out).

	DATA: "DragUP", "DragDOWN", "DragLEFT", "DragRIGHT", "Click", "DoubleClick" ...
