			One of the powerful advantages of XCSoar being open source is the ability to
			support a large amount of hardware.
			This section describes the use of XCSoar on particular Pocket PC
			devices and its integration with external devices and instruments.
			Due to the large number of devices available, it is not practical to
			include a discussion relating to every available device.
