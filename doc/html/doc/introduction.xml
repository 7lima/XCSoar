			<p>
			This document is a pilot's manual for XCSoar, an open source glide
			navigation system for Pocket PC devices.  The audience is assumed to
			have a sound knowledge of the fundamental theory of flight for
			gliders, and a basic working knowledge of cross-country soaring.
			</p>

			<p>
			Updates to the XCSoar software may result in some of this manual to be
			out of date.  You should read the release notes distributed with the
			program updates to keep track of changes.
