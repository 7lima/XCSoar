Dialog Windows

Many of the dialog windows have multiple pages of information and are
controlled in a consistent fashion.  Press the '$>>$' button to select
the next page of the dialog, and the 'OK' button do make the dialog
disappear.

\subsection{Waypoint details}
Several ways of selecting a waypoint are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item Touch its name or the waypoint symbol on the map screen if it is visible.
\item If the waypoint is in the active task, highlight the waypoint InfoBox, then use the up/down arrow keys to select the desired waypoint, and press the
enter key.
\item From the Task dialog, find and highlight the waypoint in
 the waypoint list, then press the 'Details' button.
\end{itemize}
The display will now show the waypoint details dialog.

The waypoint details dialog contains several pages:
\begin{description}
\item[Waypoint details]  
This page contains text describing the waypoint's location, elevation
and local sunset.  For airfields, the page may also include relevant
text from the Enroute Supplement about the airfield, including
runways, radio frequencies, traffic patterns, contacts.

\item[Task menu]  This page contains a menu of buttons allowing various actions to be performed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goto direct: cancels the current task and sets the waypoint as the
  single active waypoint in the task.
\item Replace active: replaces the active waypoint in the task.
\item Insert here: inserts the waypoint before the active waypoint in
  the task.
\item Remove: removes the waypoint from the task.
\item Set home: sets the waypoint as the home airfield
\end{itemize}

\item[Satellite image] This page shows a satellite image of the
waypoint.

Depending on the configuration files specified in the settings, not
all of these pages may be available.

\subsection{Analysis}

To activate the analysis dialog, select the 'Analysis' option from the
main menu.

The analysis dialog contains several pages:
\begin{description}
\item[Barograph]  Shows a graph of the history of the altitude of the glider.
  Statistics are used to estimate the thermal working band (average
  base and ceiling of climbs) and to estimate how the ceiling is
  changing over time.  The base and ceiling lines are drawn on the
  barograph.

{\it DIAGRAM SHOWING ANALYSIS BAROGRAPH PAGE}

\item[Climb history]
  Shows a bar chart of the average climb rate acheived during each
  climb.  Statistics are used to estimate the overall average climb
  rate, and to estimate how this average is changing over time.  The
  current MacCready setting is drawn on the bar chart as a thick red
  dashed line, and the climb rate trend is drawn on the chart as a
  black line.

\item[Wind at altitude]
  This shows a graph of the wind magnitude versus height, and shows the
  wind vector at several heights.

\item[Glide polar]
  This shows a graph of the glide polar at the current bugs and ballast
  setting.  It also shows the calculated best LD and the speed at which 
  it occurs, and the minumum sink and the speed at which it occurs.

\item[Temperature trace]
  This page is only available if a supported instrument is connected
  to XCSoar that produces outside air temperature and humidity.  The
  chart shows the variation of dry air temperature, dew point
  temperature and outside air temperature with height.  The convection
  forecast is summarised as the estimated thermal convection height
  and estimated cloud base.

\subsection{Status}\label{sec:status}

The status dialog is a single page of text summarising the status of
the aircraft, task, and connected devices, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item The glider's latitude and longitude and altitude
\item Sunset expressed in local time zone
\item Range and bearing to the nearest landmark
\item GPS status and number of satellites in view
\item Logger status
\end{itemize}

XXX ?? anything else, FLARM, PDA battery, glider battery?

\subsection{Bugs and ballast}

Use the Bugs/Ballast dialog to modify the polar of the glider both
before and during flight.  The bugs settings determines the amount the
polar is degraded due to contamination during a long flight.  A bugs
setting of 100\% will cause the software to use the clean polar. A
bugs setting of 50\% will degrade the polar by 50\%, effectively
doubling the sink rate.

The ballast setting is used to modify the polar to account for any
water ballast carried during the flight. A ballast setting of 100\%
modifies the polar to account for a full load of water ballast.

\subsection{Pressure}

Use this dialog both before and during the flight to record the mean
sea level atmospheric pressure, also known as QNH pressure.  The
software uses the values entered to convert airspace flight levels
into altitudes.
