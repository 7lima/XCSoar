Status messages

Status messages appear over the map area to present text for a short
period of time.  The message disappears after the time period has
elapsed, and different types of message have different periods.
Additionally, status messages can be made to disappear by
acknowledging the message.  Acknowledgement is achieved by either
pressing the enter key, or touching the status message.

Additional user buttons may be assigned to a status message repeat
function, which brings up the last message again.

Typical status messages include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Airspace queries
\item Airspace warnings
\item User interface events (e.g.\ changing display modes)
\item Glide computer events (e.g.\ takeoff, turning waypoints)
\end{itemize}
