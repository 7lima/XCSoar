Main Menu

The main menu provides the following selection of items:
\begin{description}
\item[Task]  Activates the task dialog, allowing tasks to be
  edited, saved and loaded, and for browsing waypoints by name.
\item[Bugs/Ballast]  Activates the bugs/ballast dialog,
 allowing entry of bugs and ballast percentages.
\item[Pressure] Activates the pressure dialog,
 allowing entry of QNH pressure.
\item[Logger]  Turns on or off the IGC flight logger.
 When the logger is started, the current task is written as a
 declaration at the start of the logger file. A new logger file is
 created each time the logger is started. The logger files are written
 using a subset of the IGC format although the logger is not approved
 for verification of any IGC badge or records.
\item[Settings] Provides several pages of configuration settings.
  Typically these settings are seldom changed after initial
  installation, and it is recommended they not be modified in flight.
\item[Abort] Aborts or resumes the current task.
\item[Status] Activates the Status dialog, giving a quick overview of
  system status.
\item[Analysis] Activates the Analysis dialog, giving detailed analysis
  and statistics on relating to task performance.
\item[Cancel] Returns to the map screen.
\item[Exit]  
Quit the application.  Always use this method of closing the
application as it ensures that the software is terminated cleanly.
\item[Edit infoboxes] This checkbox allows infoboxes to be edited.
