				You can <a href="/download/">download</a> the
				CAB file approriate for your organiser and install it onto a Compact Flash or
				Secure Digital card. Place it in your organiser. Use File Manager on your
				organiser to find the CAB and click on it to execute it. Follow the onscreen
				instructions, the CAB file may be deleted after installation (Windows Mobile 5
				does not delete installed CAB files).
			</p>

			<p>
				TIP: It is generally a good idea to keep the CAB file on the storage card
				so that if the organiser's power fails and the memory is lost, XCSoar
				can be reinstalled.
