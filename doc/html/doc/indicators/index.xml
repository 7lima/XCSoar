Indicators

Indicators are icons drawn on the map area to indicate system status.

\subsection{Flight modes}

XCSoar automatically detects the difference between thermal (circling)
flight and cruising flight. After about 30 seconds of circling flight
the software will switch from cruise to climb mode. After about 30
seconds of straight line flight the software will switch from climb to
cruise mode.

The cruise modes are further divided into final glide and normal
cruise.  Final glide is active when the last waypoint in the task is
active, or when the task is in abort mode.

The symbols used to indicate these modes are shown below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Climb
\item Cruise
\item Final glide
\end{itemize}
If there is no task active, then no flight mode symbol is shown.

\subsection{GPS status}

Normally, XCSoar requires a 3D GPS fix for its navigation functions.
GPS status icons and text may appear on the bottom edge of the
map display to indicate:
\begin{description}
\item[Waiting for GPS fix]  The GPS may have a 2D fix, better reception
  or additional time to search for satelites is required.
\item[GPS not connected]  No communication with the GPS is received.
  This indicates an error in the Comm port settings or the GPS device may
  be disconnected or switched off.
\end{description}

When the GPS is not connected for more than one minute, XCSoar
automatically attempts to restart communication with the device and
will then resume waiting.  This method has shown to provide the most
reliable way of recovering from communication errors.

\subsection{Flight logger}

A flight logger conforming to the IGC file specification can be used
to record flights.  The logger can be turned on and off automatically
or manually.  When the logger is active, a small diamond in the lower
right corner of the map area flashes once per second.
