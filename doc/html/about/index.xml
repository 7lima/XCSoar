		<h2>What is XCSoar</h2>
		<p>
XCSoar is a tactical glide computer
for the Pocket PC operating system.  
It was originally released as commercial software until early 2005 when it was
released as open source. The open source community has taken and embraced this
fantastic bit of code and improved it further.
		</p>
	
		<p>
XCSoar is now going through a major increase in features that are now very
comparable and in most cases favourable to the common commercial glide
computer software. See <a href="features.html">features</a> for further
information.
