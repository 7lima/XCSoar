			<title>What is XCSoar?</title>
			<p>
				XCSoar is a tactical glide computer
				for the Pocket PC operating system.  
				It was originally released as commercial software until early 2005 when it was
				released as open source. The open source community has taken and embraced this
				fantastic bit of code and improved it further.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				XCSoar is now going through a major increase in features that are now very
				comparable and in most cases favourable to the common commercial glide
				computer software. See <a href="features.html">features</a> for further
				information.
