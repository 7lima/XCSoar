		<title>File Type - xct</title>

<p>
The terrain file (extension .dat) is a raster digital elevation
model represented as an array of elevations in meters on a
latitude/longitude grid.  The format used is unique to XCSoar as it
contains a header containing the grid geometry followed by the raster
array.
</p>

<p>
Terrain files for various regions can be obtained from the XCSoar website.
Additional terrain files can be produced upon request.
