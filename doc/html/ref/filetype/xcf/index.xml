		<title>File Type - Airfield</title>

<p>
The airfield details file is a simple text format file containing
entries for each airfield, marked in square brackets in uppercase,
followed by the text to be displayed on the Waypoint Details Dialog
for that particular waypoint.
<p>

<p>
The names of airfields used in the file must correspond exactly to the
names in the waypoints file, with the exception of being converted to
uppercase.
</p>

<p>
The XCSoar website provides airfield details files for several
countries and includes tools to convert from various Enroute
Supplement sources to this file format.
</p>

<p>
Users are free to edit these files to add their own notes for
airfields that may not otherwise be included in the Enroute Supplement
sources.
