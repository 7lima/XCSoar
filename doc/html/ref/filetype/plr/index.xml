<p>
Glide polar. The WinPilot format is used for glide polar files.

XXX TODO: EXPLAIN THE FORMAT
</p>

The WinPilot and XCSoar websites provide several glide polar files.
Files for other gliders may be created upon request to the XCSoar
team.

                        Simple text file that was created by the
                        creators of WinPilot. It is unlikely to change
                        as it is already very simple to use/read.
