		<title>File Type - Topology</title>

<p>
The topology file (extension .tpl) is a text file containing a
series of entries each of which define a layer of topology.  Typical
layers include roads, railway lines, large built-up areas (cities),
miscellaneous populated areas (towns and villages), lakes and rivers.
</p>

<p>
The topology file defines which features are to be displayed, their
color, maximum zoom visibility, icons, and labelling.  This file can
be customised, for example to add or remove specific layers.  Details
on the file format will be provided in a separate document.  The
topology data itself uses ERSI Shapefiles which are generated from the
freely available VMAP0 database.
</p>

<p>
Topology files for various regions can be obtained from the XCSoar
website.  Additional topology files can be produced upon request.
