			<title>Data</title>

			<p>This is by far the big important section of any application
			like this. We have great plans and great code here for
			generating data from free sources for any area in the world.
			However it is by no means a trivial task. As such we are
			building a set of tools to generate the data. To do so we will
			need about 3 GB of disk storage for the original files. This is
			not a problem for us long term, but we are not ready for that.
			</p>
			<p>
			For now, please contact the users list with the data area you
			need or try and generate it yourself with the tools in CVS.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here are some we have already prepared
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a
						href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=141663&amp;package_id=157326"
					>
						including:
						Benalla, Alps, Bayreuth, Germany, Slovakia and UK -
						more to come
					</a>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			Data formats used by XCSoar and sources of data are listed below.
			<ul>
				<li> Waypoints: Cambridge .dat format.  The
				<a href="http://soaring.aerobatics.ws/TP/"> Worldwide Soaring Turnpoint Exchange</a> is a good source of waypoint files.</li>

				<li> Airspace: OpenAir .txt format.  The
				<a href="http://soaring.aerobatics.ws/SUA/HomePage.html"> Worldwide Soaring Turnpoint Exchange </a> has a section on Special Use Airspace. </li>

				<li> Glide polars: WinPilot .plr format.  These can be obtained
				from the <a href="http://www.winpilot.com/polar.asp"> WinPilot </a> site. </li>

			<title>Source Code</title>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=141663">
						CVS
					</a> - considering the high turn over of code,
					this is the best place to get the source.
		
					<p>
					The latest CVS tarball is available 
					<a href="../xcsoar-nightlyCVS.tar.gz">here</a>.
