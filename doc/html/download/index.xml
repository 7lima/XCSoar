				Please download the appropriate version for
your organiser. You can find out what version of Pocket PC you are running by
clicking on Start/Settings/About. You are looking for something along the lines
of "Pocket PC 2003". 
			</p>
			<p>
				Words like BETA and Release Candidate are used
to represent versions that have not yet been released as stable by the
development team. You are best to go for the version with the greatest number
that is marked stable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Version numbers such as 4.3 is great than a
number such as 4.22 - the 3 is more significant than the 2.

			<title>Data</title>

			<p>This is by far the big important section of any application
			like this. We have great plans and great code here for
			generating data from free sources for any area in the world.
			However it is by no means a trivial task. As such we are
			building a set of tools to generate the data. To do so we will
			need about 3 GB of disk storage for the original files. This is
			not a problem for us long term, but we are not ready for that.
			</p>
			<p>
			For now, please contact the users list with the data area you
			need or try and generate it yourself with the tools in CVS.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here are some we have already prepared
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a
						href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=141663&amp;package_id=157326"
					>
						including:
						Benalla, Alps, Bayreuth, Germany, Slovakia and UK -
						more to come
					</a>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			Data formats used by XCSoar and sources of data are listed below.
			<ul>
				<li> Waypoints: Cambridge .dat format.  The
				<a href="http://soaring.aerobatics.ws/TP/"> Worldwide Soaring Turnpoint Exchange</a> is a good source of waypoint files.</li>

				<li> Airspace: OpenAir .txt format.  The
				<a href="http://soaring.aerobatics.ws/SUA/HomePage.html"> Worldwide Soaring Turnpoint Exchange </a> has a section on Special Use Airspace. </li>

				<li> Glide polars: WinPilot .plr format.  These can be obtained
				from the <a href="http://www.winpilot.com/polar.asp"> WinPilot </a> site. </li>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=141663">
						CVS
					</a> - considering the high turn over of code,
					this is the best place to get the source.
		
					<p>
					The latest CVS tarball is available 
					<a href="../xcsoar-nightlyCVS.tar.gz">here</a>.
