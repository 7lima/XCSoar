- Terrain safety height is the height above terrain at which XCSoar
considers you're too low to cross.  This is only used in calculating the
final glide through terrain and glide reach.

- Arrival height is the height above the landpoint that you would which
to arrive in a cross-country task.  For example, many people set this at
a safe circuit joining height plus maybe a small margin.

- Break-off height is the height above terrain when flying
cross-country, below which you should be looking for airfields or
outlanding options.  XCSoar doesn't do very much with this just yet.

All are done through GPS I believe.
