      * The contents of the UK topo zip archive do not match the list of
        V4.22 file extensions in the online reference manual. Should I
        just unzip them and shovel them onto the iPAQ anyway?

Yup.  The .tpl file is the main file that XCSoar uses, the other files
are the actual shape files (if you look at the .tpl file you will see
the other files referenced, but they have extensions .shp etc).
