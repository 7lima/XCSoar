		<question>
		      Where should I be installing all these data files on the iPAQ?
		</question>
		<answer>
			Wherever you like.  I put them in "My Documents".  Don't put them in the
			"IPAQ file store" (if you have one) because that part of RAM uses flash
			and it is very slow and has limited read/write before failure (some big
			number, but better safe than sorry).
