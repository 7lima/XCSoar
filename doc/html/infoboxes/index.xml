<section>
  <title>Info Boxes</title>
<p>
Infobox data types are grouped into logical categories.  The type of a
particular infobox may be cycled through each type within its category
by pressing the application buttons 2 and 3 when the infobox is
highlighted.
</p>

<p>
All infoboxes display their data in user-specified units.  Where data
is invalid, the displayed value will be '---'.  This happens, for
example, when no terrain data is found or in range for the Terrain
Elevation infobox type.
</p>

<p>
In the following description of the infobox data types, the first
title is as it appears in the infobox configuration dialog box, the
second title is the label used in the infobox title.  Note that these
labels have changed since older versions (pre V4.2) of XCSoar.
</p>

<section>		<title>Altitude group</title>

<dl>
<dt>Height GPS: H GPS</dt>
<dd>
This is the height above mean sea level reported by the GPS.
In simulation mode, this value is adjustable with the up/down arrow keys.
When this infobox is active, the right/left arrow keys also cause the
glider to turn.
</dd>

<dt>Height AGL: H AGL</dt>
<dd>
This is the GPS altitude minus the terrain height obtained from the
terrain file.  The value is colored red when the glider is below the
terrain safety clearance height.
</dd>
 
<dt>Terrain Elevation: H Gnd</dt>
<dd>
This is the elevation of the terrain above mean sea level obtained 
from the terrain file.
</dd>

<dt>Pressure Altitude: H Baro</dt>
<dd>
This is the barometric altitude obtained from a GPS equipped with
pressure sensor, or a supported external intelligent vario.

<section>
<title>Glide ratio group</title>
<dl>
<dt>L/D instantaneous: L/D Inst</dt>
<dd>Instantaneous glide ratio, given by the ground speed divided by the

bugs and ballast dialog.
</dd>

<dt>L/D cruise: L/D Cru</dt>
<dd>
The distance from the top of the last thermal, divided by the altitude
lost since the top of the last thermal.  Negative values indicate
climbing cruise (height gain since leaving the last thermal).  If the
vertical speed is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.
</dd> 

<dt>Final L/D: Fin L/D</dt>
<dd>
The required glide ratio to finish the task, given by the distance to
go divided by the height required to arrive at the safety arrival
altitude.  Negative values indicate a climb is necessary to finish.
If the height required is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.
</dd>

<dt>Next L/D: WP L/D</dt>
<dd>
The required glide ratio to reach the next waypoint, given by the
distance to next waypoint divided by the height required to arrive at
the safety arrival altitude.  Negative values indicate a climb is
necessary to reach the waypoint.  If the height required is close to
zero, the displayed value is '---'.

<dt>Netto Vario: Netto</dt>
<dd>
Instantaneous vertical speed of airmass, equal to vario value less the
glider's estimated sink rate.  Best used if airspeed, accelerometers and vario are connected, otherwise calculations are based on GPS measurements and wind estimates.

calculated for descent.  In climb mode, this switches to the speed for
minimum sink at the current load factor (if an accelerometer is connected).
