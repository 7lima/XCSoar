<p>
Welcome to the XCSoar website.  XCSoar is a tactical glide computer
for the Pocket PC operating system.  It runs on old hardware (PPC
platform) through to WM2003SE.  WM2005 will be supported when devices
become available.</p>

At present we are mainly using <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/XCSoar/">this yahoo mailing list</a> for development and announcements.  We will shortly be moving most of our email communications to the <a href="">sourceforge mailing lists</a>
