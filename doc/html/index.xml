	<title>XCSoar - Welcome</title>

	<p>
	XCSoar is a tactical glide computer
	for the Pocket PC operating system.  It runs on old hardware (PPC
	platform) through to WM2003SE.  WM2005 will be supported when devices
	become available (work has already been started).</p>

	<p>
	XCSoar is free software according to the GNU Public Licence.  As such,
	you are free to download the software as binaries and as source code, and we encourage input from
	users.  Please use the <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xcsoar/">sourceforge project
	page</a> to submit bugs and request features.  
	</p>


	<p>
	We were using <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/XCSoar/">this yahoo
	mailing list</a> for development and announcements.  It is almost all done
	now via email communications to the 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=141663">sourceforge mailing lists</a> 
	</p>

	<p>
	NOTE: pending the release of 4.5 - a new set of documentation has been
	added. The majority of this new documentation pertains only to version 4.5
	which will be released in September 2005. This is a major new release with some
	very exciting new features.
