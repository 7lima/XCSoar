\chapter{{\InfoBox} Reference}\label{cha:infobox}
Infobox data types are grouped into logical categories.

All InfoBoxes display their data in user-specified units.  Where data
is invalid, the displayed value will be '---' and the contents are
greyed out.  This happens, for example, when no terrain data is found
or it is not in range for the Terrain Elevation infobox type.

In the following description of the infobox data types, the first
title is as it appears in the infobox configuration dialog box, the
second title is the label used in the infobox title.

\section{Altitude} %0,1,20,33,70

\ibi{Height GPS}{H GPS}{This is the height above mean sea level reported by the
GPS. Touchscreen/PC only: in simulation mode, this value is adjustable with the
up/down arrow keys. The right/left arrow keys also cause the glider to turn.}
\ibi{Height AGL}{H AGL}{This is the navigation altitude minus the terrain height
obtained from the terrain file. The value is coloured red when the glider is
below the terrain safety clearance height.}
\ibi{Terrain Elevation}{H Gnd}{This is the elevation of the terrain above mean
sea level obtained from the terrain file at the current GPS location.}
\ibi{Pressure Altitude}{H Baro}{This is the barometric altitude obtained from a
GPS equipped with pressure sensor or a supported external intelligent vario.}
\ibi{QFE GPS}{QFE GPS}{This is the height above the home airfield calculated
by subtracting the airfield elevation from the altitude reported by the GPS.}

\section{Aircraft state} %3,6,23,32,37,47,54

\ibi{Bearing}{Bearing}{True bearing of the next waypoint. For AAT tasks, this
is the true bearing to the target within the AAT sector.}
\ibi{Speed ground}{V Gnd}{Ground speed measured by the GPS. If this infobox is
active in simulation mode, pressing the up and down arrows adjusts the speed, 
left and right turns the glider.}
\ibi{Track}{Track}{Magnetic track reported by the GPS. Touchscreen/PC only: If
this infobox is active in simulation mode, pressing the up and down arrows
adjusts the track.}
\ibi{Airspeed IAS}{V IAS}{Indicated Airspeed reported by a supported external
intelligent vario.}
\ibi{G load}{G}{Magnitude of G loading reported by a supported external
intelligent vario. This value is negative for pitch-down manoeuvres.}
\ibi{Bearing Difference}{Brng D}{The difference between the glider's track
bearing, to the bearing of the next waypoint, or for AAT tasks, to the bearing
to the target within the AAT sector. GPS navigation is based on the track
bearing across the ground, and this track bearing may differ from the glider's
heading when there is wind present. Chevrons point to the direction the glider
needs to alter course to correct the bearing difference, that is, so that the
glider's course made good is pointing directly at the next waypoint.  This
bearing takes into account the curvature of the Earth.}
\ibi{Airspeed TAS}{V TAS}{True Airspeed reported by a supported external 
intelligent vario.}

\section{Glide ratio} % 4,5,19,66,38,53,71

\ibi{L/D instantaneous}{L/D Inst}{Instantaneous glide ratio, given by the ground
speed divided by the vertical speed (GPS speed) over the last 20 seconds. 
Negative values indicate climbing cruise. If the vertical speed is close to
zero, the displayed value is '---'.
If this infobox is active, pressing the enter cursor button brings up the
bugs and ballast dialog.}
\ibi{L/D cruise}{L/D Cru}{The distance from the top of the last thermal, 
divided by the altitude lost since the top of the last thermal. Negative values
indicate climbing cruise (height gain since leaving the last thermal). If the
vertical speed is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.}
\ibi{Final L/D}{Fin L/D}{The required glide ratio to finish the task, given by
the distance to go divided by the height required to arrive at the safety 
arrival altitude. Negative values indicate a climb is necessary to finish. If
the height required is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.}
\ibi{Final GR}{Fin GR}{Geometric gradient to the arrival height above the final
waypoint. This is not adjusted for total energy.} 
\ibi{Next L/D}{WP L/D}{The required glide ratio to reach the next waypoint,
given by the distance to next waypoint divided by the height required to arrive
at the safety arrival altitude.  Negative values indicate a climb is necessary
to reach the waypoint.  If the height required is close to zero, the displayed
value is '---'.}
\ibi{L/D vario}{L/D vario}{Instantaneous glide ratio, given by the indicated
airspeed divided by the total energy vertical speed, when connected to an
intelligent variometer.  Negative values indicate climbing cruise. If the total
energy vario speed is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.}
\ibi{L/D Average}{L/D Avg}{The distance made in the configured period of time ,
divided by the altitude lost since then. Negative values are shown as 
\^{ }\^{ }\^{ } and indicate climbing cruise (height gain). Over 200 of LD the
value is shown as +++ . You can configure the period of averaging in the Special config menu.
Suggested values for this configuration are 60, 90 or 120: lower values will be closed to 
LD INST, and higher values will be closed to LD Cruise. Notice that the distance 
is NOT the straight line between your old and current position: it's exactly the 
distance you have made even in a zigzag glide. This value is not calculated while 
circling.}

\section{Variometer} % 2,7,8,9,21,22,63,24,44

current load factor (if an accelerometer is connected). When Block mode speed to
fly is selected, this infobox displays the MacCready speed.}
