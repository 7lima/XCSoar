===========
TASK SYSTEM
===========

- Task system
  - Have separate Arm modes for AAT and non-AAT modes?
  - Different ways of calculating average speed
    - Based on manual input or task average
  - Add 'PanTo' waypoint function, to pan towards the selected waypoint
  - (Feature request 1237800) Preserve TPs in tasks when waypoint file changed
- AAT support:
  - More accurate calculation of ETA etc with respect to final glide fraction
  - Calculator, What if I leave now?
- Task statistics
  - Need to track average speed and time spent on each leg for statistics
    review after flight.
- Task abort, when many airfields available, sort along task direction

=====================
AIRSPACE AND WARNINGS
=====================

- Airspace
  - ** (Feature request 1399775) configurable border thickness
  - Sort nearest above/below
- Warnings and voice prompts (issued directly and passed to Vega, gce?)
  - Final glide through terrain
  - Distance to waypoint readout
  - Passing task waypoints
  - Airspace
  - Fast descent freezing
  - Implement the Vega protocol in XCSoar
  - Terrain out of range

==============
GLIDE COMPUTER
==============

- Wind calculations
  - Compass wind estimator
- Flight modes
  - (Feature request 1459280) user-commanded flight modes
  - In climb stats page, show direction of circling
- Pirker analysis:
  - Given a height available, what maccready gives zero arrival altitude?
  - This can be used to make automc more efficient
  - Final glide calculations to be made with respect to true airspeed,
    variation of wind with height: glide angle doesn't change, but
    speed does (and therefore time) as well as wind relative to indicated
    airspeed.  ->
      do calculations over 10 steps, optimal at each step, in terms of
      indicated airspeed, then convert to true airspeed for time and
      distance/height calculations.
- Smart mcready management
  - Scale MC value to allow for decreased thermal strength with low altitude
  - Scale MC value to allow for risk of not encountering thermal with low
    altitude (and take into account wind factor here?)
  - Allow user to adjust optimism/pessimism
  - Scale MC value with thermal profile?
- Calculations for cloud streets
  - draw rough lines for streets and to indicate traversal track
- Density altitude correction factors for speeds, climb rates etc
- (Idea) Calculate/display thermal drift as % of wind speed
- Detect flying backwards in strong headwinds
  - Currently, wind calculation will fail if going backwards
  - Can detect this from rapid change in heading (approx 180 degrees)
  - If we know roughly the wind, can estimate what the glider heading is.
- Detect when `circling' but not in thermal (e.g. ridge, wave), in order
  to disable trail drift and thermal centering drift calculations.
- Ballast
  - Allow entry of pilot weight, recalculation of ballast limits

===================
MARKS AND WAYPOINTS
===================

- Waypoints
  - Cursor keys to allow moving to next waypoints in direction of cursor.
  - Scan waypoints for duplicates (close within a range), don't remove
    duplicates if they are different types (airfield vs non-airfield)

===========================
MAP, GAUGE AND ICON DISPLAY
===========================

- Info icons/symbols
  - GPS signal strength --> could be good for status dialog.
- Display elements
  - Speed to fly bars visibility in fullscreen
- Terrain rendering
  - (Feature request 1370830) display satellite weather imagery on map
  - Predefined brightness/contrast settings
  - (Idea) Draw land use with pattern, for areas of forrest or crop fields
     -- Do this with pattern brush over top of normal terrain/topo
- Gauges
  - (Bug 1459609) CDI gauge rewrite to use vector graphics

=============
CONFIGURATION
=============

- Fonts
  - Adjustable font for long infoboxes (especially time)
- Configuration wizard?
- Set home/teamcode in configuration settings?

==============
USER INTERFACE
==============

- Status messages
  - Colored status messages?
- Miscellaneous UI
  - Password protect on settings
- Input events
  - Timed buttons (pass time of button press to processKey and support
    threshold passing in InputEvents - eg: Set long press as nnn ms -
    over that is long press, under is short) (assume for simplicity that
    we still only press single buttons at a time - thus time last
    button.
  - Consider support of double click (harder...)
- Check key repeat, hardware dependent?

=====================
SYSTEM/INFRASTRUCTURE
=====================

- Robustness
  - Revert to default aircraft type if polar file doesn't exist or invalid
  - Log file to report errors, include file and line number
  - Fix LocalPath so it is thread safe
- Miscellaneous
  - (Bug 1428871) PPC2002 installer chooses wrong CAB
  - (Bug 1366492) Logger start sensitivity
- Comms
  - Robustness for PC version, currently hanging on restart
  - Need 3 ports for full support of Altair.
- Battery management
  - Low battery exit is not working, fix it.
  - Improved notification of battery level - not just simulator.
    (exit should still only be the simulator)
  - Notify the user (via GCE to Input) of switching between AC and Battery mode
  - Altair autoshutdown on no activity for 15 minutes
- Profiles:
  - Need profile save page

=============
DOCUMENTATION
=============
    
- Start/Finish line: 'radius' parameter is half line width
- Explain more about task starting, valid task starts etc
- Update configuration screenshots and text
- Make sure all release note info is in the manual.
- Better description of prioritisation of messages
- Better description of speed command sounds
- Better description of auto mc
- Better description of how to add new tasks
- Document online contest
- Document thermal locator
